# TechJobs

I built this app as a part of LaunchCode coursework. It allows staffers to create, browse and search listings of open jobs by employer partners.

## Current State

This Spring Boot application was built with Gradle and features object-relational mapping, or ORM, where objects are used to connect the programming language to a database on a local machine.
User-created job data can be accessed and stored via integration with MySQL.

## Future Implementation

I'm looking to persist TechJobs on a cloud service like Heroku with possible MongoDB integration.
